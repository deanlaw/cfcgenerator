= Introduction =

This is a description of the currently included default templates with the project.


= Details =
*default* : this is just a standard set of templates for object-oriented development. They are built for the code that _I_ write and so the idea is you would customize templates to generate code like _you_ write.

*prototype* : nothing more than a copy of default but this is the one you should modify/copy if you intend to create your own template. I don't recommend changing default since your changes may get overwritten in future versions.

*prototypeCFM* : this is generally the same as the above but intended as an example of how you would create a template using CFML instead of XSL.

*builds1-7* : when I released build 8 I made some significant changes to the default template. This was included to allow people who were already coding against the old templates to continue to use them as is.

*transfer* : this is for generating code to work with Mark Mandel's Transfer ORM project.
