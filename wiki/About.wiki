About the generator.


= Details =

The Illudium PU-36 Code Generator uses database metadata that it converts into a custom
XML format and applies to XSL templates to generate ColdFusion code for you. While most of
the templates generate ColdFusion components (cfc), the generator can generate any type of
code. Out of the box it also includes some XML templates as well as a simple ActionScript
value object template. Keep in mind, the generated code is intended as a starting point
for you to customize, not an end point.
